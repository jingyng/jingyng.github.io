I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Information and Computing Science at the Hubei University of Technology in China, followed by a Master’s degree in Computer Science at Hunan University, China. My Master’s dissertation is related to identifying 3D printed objects and printers with Digital Forensics and Machine Learning. After obtaining my Master’s degree in 2019, I pursued a PhD at the RECOD.ai lab from the University of Campinas in Brazil, under the supervision of Prof. [Anderson Rocha](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~rocha/). During 2022-2023, I did a research internship at the [Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing (UKP) lab](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/index.en.jsp) in TU Darmstadt. My PhD thesis is related to improving fact-checking efficiency and explainability with few-shot learning and large language models. 

I am currently working as a post-doc researcher at the XplaiNLP group in TU Berlin, focusing on topics related to generating natural language explanations for AI-based disinformation detection. Specifically, my research interests are:

- Natural language explanation generation
- Large language model tuning/prompting
- Synthetic text evaluation
- Human preference study on text generation
