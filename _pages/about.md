Hi there! I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Campinas, Brazil, where I am a member of [RECOD.ai](http://recod.ai/) lab. since 2019, August. My advisor is Prof. [Anderson Rocha](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~rocha/). 

My research focuses on improving methods for automated fact-checking. I am especially interested in making fact-checking more explainable through question answering. Thematically, I am interested in fact-checking, question answering, information retrieval, and explainable AI.
